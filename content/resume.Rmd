Hello there! My name is Daelon Morais, but you probably already know that since you're checking out my website. No, you clicked on the "Resume" tab to learn much more than just my name, and I'm here to deliver.

I'm naturally curious about so many eclectic subjects and being in the "Information Age" gives me unparalleled access to anything and everything I want to explore. Therefore, while my goal is to someday join the medical field, in my downtime, I like to dabble. My main areas of burgeoning exploration are in music, building, cooking, and coding.
